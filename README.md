# MiniAlexa

I have tried to make virtual assistant by using speech recognition, text to speech conversion and many more python modules. Following features are provided by the virtual assistant.

1)	When user say ‘Alexa play believer song’ – alexa will automatically open youtube and play the first search result.
2)	When user say ‘Alexa what’s the time’ – alexa will tell the current timing to the user.
3)  When user day 'Alexa tell some jokes' - alexa will tell some jokes.
4)  When user say ‘Alexa set alarm at 15 hour 10 minutes’ – alexa will set and play alarm at that time.
5)  When user say ‘Alexa send whatsapp message’ - alexa will open the web.whatsapp.com and message at particular time given by the user.(user must give time after 5-10 minutes)
6)  When user say ‘Alexa set reminder’ - alexa will set reminder for particular subject at given date/time.
